each image has two label bytes (coarse and fine) and 3072 pixel bytes, so the binary files look like this:
<1 x coarse label><1 x fine label><3072 x pixel>

The 3072 bytes are the values of the pixels of the image. (32x32 colour image)
The first 1024 bytes are the red channel values, the next 1024 the green, and the final 1024 the blue.

The values are stored in row-major order, so the first 32 bytes are the red channel values of the first row of the image.
