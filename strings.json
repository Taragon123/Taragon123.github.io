This will take your previously trained AI model and reuse it, only modifying the last output layer. <br>Once you've played with different labels and experimented with how well your model generalizes, you can experiemnt with changing the network configuration. This will change the configutration of the AI model, which can have some big impacts on how well the model preforms and how well it generalizes."
